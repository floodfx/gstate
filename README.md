# gstate

A type-safe Statechart library for Go, inspired by [XState](https://xstate.js.org/).

`gstate` allows you to model complex application logic using finite state machines and statecharts. Unlike traditional logic scattered across `if/else` blocks and boolean flags, statecharts provide a formal, visual, and structured way to define how your system behaves.

## What is a Statechart?

A Statechart is an extension of a Finite State Machine (FSM). While a basic FSM has a set of states and transitions, a Statechart adds:
- **Hierarchy**: States can contain other states (Nested States).
- **Orthogonality**: Multiple states can be active at once (Parallel States).
- **Broadcast**: Events can trigger transitions in multiple regions.
- **History**: The ability to "remember" where you were before leaving a state.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/floodfx/gstate
```

---

## 1. The Basics: States, Events, and Transitions

Every statechart starts with three core concepts:
- **State**: A specific condition or "mode" of your system (e.g., `Idle`, `Loading`, `Success`).
- **Event**: Something that happens (e.g., `START`, `MOUSE_CLICK`, `TIMEOUT`).
- **Transition**: A rule that says: "When in state A, if event E happens, move to state B."

### Example: A Simple Toggle with Typed Constants
```go
type MyState string
type MyEvent string

const (
    StateOff MyState = "off"
    StateOn  MyState = "on"
)

const (
    EventToggle MyEvent = "TOGGLE"
)

machine := gstate.New[MyState, MyEvent, any]("toggle").
    Initial(StateOff).
    State(StateOff, func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, any]) {
        s.On(EventToggle).GoTo(StateOn)
    }).
    State(StateOn, func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, any]) {
        s.On(EventToggle).GoTo(StateOff)
    }).
    Build()
```

> **Try it:** [basics example](./examples/basics) — states, events, transitions, context, and entry/exit actions.

---

## 2. Type Safety & Generics

One of the core strengths of `gstate` is its use of Go 1.18+ generics to provide strict type safety.

The library uses three generic parameters: `[S ~string, E ~string, C any]`.

- **`S` (State ID)**: By using a custom string type (e.g., `type MyState string`), you ensure that `Initial()`, `State()`, and `GoTo()` only accept valid state identifiers.
- **`E` (Event ID)**: Similarly, `On(event)` only accepts events of your specific type.
- **`C` (Context)**: The data your machine holds is strictly typed. Actions and guards receive this exact type, eliminating the need for `interface{}` casting.

**Benefits:**
- **No Typos**: Compilers will catch `actor.Send("TYPO")` if your event type is strictly defined.
- **IDE Support**: Autocomplete works for states, events, and context fields.
- **Safety**: Guards and Actions are verified at compile time to work with your specific data structure.

---

## 3. Managing Data with Context (`Assign`)

Statecharts aren't just about labels; they often need to hold data. In `gstate`, this is called **Context**.

Transitions can perform **Actions** to update this data. In Go, these are pure functions: `func(C) C`.

```go
type CounterCtx struct {
    Count int
}

s.On("INCREMENT").
    Assign(func(c CounterCtx) CounterCtx {
        c.Count++
        return c
    })
```

#### Safe Snapshots with `Cloner`

If your Context contains reference types (pointers, slices, maps), `Snapshot()` and `Context()` might suffer from race conditions or shared state. You can implement the `Cloner` interface to provide a deep copy:

```go
type MyCtx struct {
    Data []int
}

func (c MyCtx) Clone() MyCtx {
    newData := make([]int, len(c.Data))
    copy(newData, c.Data)
    return MyCtx{Data: newData}
}
```

---

## 4. Entry and Exit Actions

States can define actions that run whenever they are entered or exited. This is useful for setup/teardown, logging, or any side effect tied to a state's lifecycle.

```go
s.State(StateActive, func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    s.Entry(func(c MyContext) MyContext {
        fmt.Println("[active] Entering state...")
        return c
    })

    s.Exit(func(c MyContext) MyContext {
        fmt.Println("[active] Leaving state...")
        return c
    })

    s.On(EventStop).GoTo(StateIdle)
})
```

- **`Entry`** runs when the state is entered, before any child states are resolved.
- **`Exit`** runs when the state is left, as part of the transition.

---

## 5. Hierarchical (Nested) States

In a complex system, some states are "sub-modes" of others. For example, a `User` state might have `Guest` and `LoggedIn` sub-states.

**Why use this?**
- **Bubbling**: If a child state doesn't handle an event, it "bubbles up" to the parent.
- **Organization**: Group related logic together.
- **Common Actions**: Define an `Entry` action on a parent that runs regardless of which child is entered.

```go
s.State("parent", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    s.Initial("childA")
    
    // If ANY child receives "RESET", we go to "parent.childA"
    s.On("RESET").GoTo("childA")

    s.State("childA", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) { ... })
    s.State("childB", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) { ... })
})
```

> **Try it:** [hierarchy example](./examples/hierarchy) — nested states with event bubbling and entry/exit ordering.

---

## 6. History States

History allows a compound state to remember which of its children was active before it was exited. When you re-enter the state, it resumes where it left off instead of going to the `Initial` child.

Two history types are available:
- **`gstate.Shallow`**: Remembers the direct child that was active.
- **`gstate.Deep`**: Remembers all active descendants in the hierarchy.

```go
machine := gstate.New[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]("history_demo").
    Initial("app").
    State("app", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
        s.History(gstate.Shallow)
        s.Initial("screen1")

        s.State("screen1", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
            s.On("SWITCH").GoTo("screen2")
        })
        s.State("screen2", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
            s.On("SWITCH").GoTo("screen1")
        })

        s.On("GO_IDLE").GoTo("idle")
    }).
    State("idle", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
        s.On("WAKE").GoTo("app")
    }).
    Build()
```

In this example, if the user navigates to `screen2` and then goes idle, `WAKE` will return them to `screen2` (not the initial `screen1`).

> **Try it:** [history example](./examples/history) — shallow history remembers which child was active.

---

## 7. Parallel States

Sometimes a system is in multiple modes at once. A text editor might be `Focused` while also having `Bold` enabled.

Parallel states allow you to define regions that operate independently. Use `actor.States()` to see all active states.

```go
s.State("active", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    s.Type(gstate.Parallel)

    s.State("keyboard", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
        s.Initial("caps_off")
        s.State("caps_off", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
            s.On("CAPS_LOCK").GoTo("caps_on")
        })
        s.State("caps_on", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
            s.On("CAPS_LOCK").GoTo("caps_off")
        })
    })

    s.State("mouse", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
        s.Initial("not_clicked")
        s.State("not_clicked", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
            s.On("CLICK").GoTo("clicked")
        })
        s.State("clicked", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
            s.On("RELEASE").GoTo("not_clicked")
        })
    })
})

// ...
fmt.Printf("Active States: %v\n", actor.States())
// Output: Active States: [active keyboard caps_off mouse not_clicked]
```

> **Try it:** [parallel example](./examples/parallel) — independent keyboard and mouse regions.

---

## 8. Side Effects: Invoke and After

### Invoked Services (`Invoke`)
Used for asynchronous work (like an API call). The service starts when you enter the state and is **automatically cancelled** (via `context.Context`) if you leave the state before it finishes.

```go
s.Invoke(func(ctx context.Context, c MyCtx) error {
    // This goroutine is managed by the Actor
    return doExpensiveWork(ctx)
}, "onSuccessState", "onErrorState")
```

### Delayed Transitions (`After`)
Transitions that happen automatically after a duration.

```go
s.State("loading", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    // If we are stuck here for 5 seconds, move to "error"
    s.After(5 * time.Second).GoTo("error")
})
```

> **Try it:** [invoke example](./examples/invoke) — async services with cancellation. [delayed example](./examples/delayed) — automatic timeouts.

---

## 9. Transient Logic (`Always`)

`Always` transitions fire immediately if their **Guard** (a condition function) is met. They don't wait for an external event. This is useful for "decider" states.

```go
s.State("check_balance", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    s.Always().
        Guard(func(c MyCtx) bool { return c.Balance > 100 }).
        GoTo("premium_user")
    
    s.Always().GoTo("regular_user") // Fallback
})
```

---

## 10. Final States

A `Final` state indicates the completion of its parent's process. Once entered, no further transitions are processed from that state.

```go
s.State("done", func(s *gstate.StateBuilder[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    s.Type(gstate.Final)
})
```

> **Try it:** [agent example](./examples/agent) — guards, always transitions, retries, and final states in a real workflow.

---

## 11. Observing Lifecycle Events

When you want to record transitions, guard outcomes, state entries/exits, transition actions, and invoked services — for telemetry, tracing, audit logs, or just to debug what your machine is doing — you do **not** need to wrap every `Entry`, `Exit`, `Guard`, and `Invoke` by hand. Pass an `Observer` to `Start`:

```go
obs := &gstate.RecordingObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]{}
actor := gstate.Start(machine, MyContext{},
    gstate.WithObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext](obs),
)
```

The nine hooks on `Observer[S, E, C]`:

| Hook | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `OnEventReceived` | An event lands in the mailbox and is about to be processed |
| `OnGuardEvaluated` | A non-nil `Guard` was evaluated (carries the boolean result) |
| `OnEventDropped` | An event was processed but no transition fired (`Reason: "no_transition"`) |
| `OnStateExited` | A state's `Exit` actions completed and the state was removed from `active` |
| `OnActionExecuted` | A transition's `Action` (Assign) completed |
| `OnStateEntered` | A state's `Entry` actions completed and the state is now `active` |
| `OnTransition` | A transition fully resolved (after all exits + entries) |
| `OnInvokeStarted` | An invoked service goroutine was launched |
| `OnInvokeCompleted` | An invoked service returned (success, error, or cancellation) |

### Threading and locking contract

- All callbacks except `OnInvokeStarted` / `OnInvokeCompleted` run **synchronously on the actor's event-processing goroutine** while it holds the actor's internal write lock. Implementations must be non-blocking.
- Observers **must not** call methods on the same `Actor` that would re-enter the actor lock (e.g. `Snapshot()`, `State()`). They may call `Send` / `SendCtx`, which only enqueue.
- The `Context *C` field on each payload points to a **defensive copy** of the actor's context taken at the moment the hook fires. Reading is safe and accurately reflects state at that point; mutating the pointee has no effect on the actor. If `C` implements `Cloner`, that deep copy is used.
- `OnInvokeStarted` / `OnInvokeCompleted` fire from the invoke goroutine and do not hold the actor lock.

### Implementing only the methods you care about (`NopObserver`)

Embed `NopObserver[S, E, C]` to satisfy the interface with no-ops, then override what you want:

```go
type loggingObs struct {
    gstate.NopObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]
}

func (l *loggingObs) OnTransition(ctx context.Context, e gstate.TransitionEvent[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]) {
    log.Printf("[%s] %s --%s--> %s", e.ActorID, e.From, e.Event, e.To)
}
```

### Inspecting behavior with `RecordingObserver`

`RecordingObserver[S, E, C]` captures every callback into a thread-safe log. It is useful in tests and for ad-hoc debugging:

```go
rec := &gstate.RecordingObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]{}
actor := gstate.Start(machine, MyContext{},
    gstate.WithObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext](rec),
)
actor.Send(EventGo)

for _, t := range rec.Transitions() {
    fmt.Printf("%s -> %s on %s\n", t.From, t.To, t.Event)
}

// or by kind:
for _, ev := range rec.Events(gstate.KindGuardEvaluated, gstate.KindTransition) {
    fmt.Printf("%s @ %s: %+v\n", ev.Kind, ev.Timestamp.Format(time.RFC3339Nano), ev.Payload)
}
```

> **Try it:** [observer example](./examples/observer) — attach a `RecordingObserver` to a small machine and print the lifecycle log.

### Printing and serializing payloads

Every payload type implements `fmt.Stringer` with a short, stable format, so `fmt.Println(e)` produces readable output. `RecordedEvent.String()` delegates to the embedded payload, so a recorder log can be dumped with a single `fmt.Println(ev)`:

```go
for _, ev := range rec.Events() {
    fmt.Println(ev)
    // transition: transition[V1StGXR8_Z5j]: idle --GO--> active
    // guard: guard[V1StGXR8_Z5j]: idle --GO[active]: result=true
    // ...
}
```

Payload structs also carry `json` tags, so they can be marshaled directly for shipping to a telemetry pipeline. `InvokeEvent.Error` is rendered as its `Error()` string (or omitted when nil) via a custom `MarshalJSON`:

```go
b, _ := json.Marshal(rec.Transitions()[0])
// {"machine_id":"...","actor_id":"V1StGXR8_Z5j","from":"idle","to":"active","event":"GO","context":{...},"timestamp":"..."}
```

---

## The Actor: Running a Machine

A `Machine` is a static blueprint. To actually run it, you create an **Actor**. The Actor holds the live state, processes events, and manages async services.

### Creating an Actor

```go
// Start with default options
actor := gstate.Start(machine, MyContext{Count: 0})

// Or with one or more functional options
actor := gstate.Start(machine, MyContext{Count: 0},
    gstate.WithMailboxSize[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext](500),
    gstate.WithObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext](myObs),
    gstate.WithActorID[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]("worker-42"),
)
```

Available options:

- `WithMailboxSize(n)` — buffered capacity for the event channel. Default `100`.
- `WithObserver(obs)` — install an [`Observer`](#11-observing-lifecycle-events). Default is a no-op.
- `WithActorID(id)` — override the auto-generated [`ActorID`](#actor-identity).

### Actor Identity

Every actor is born with a stable `ActorID`. When you don't supply one via `WithActorID`, `Start` generates a short URL-safe nanoid:

```go
actor := gstate.Start(machine, MyContext{})
fmt.Println(actor.ID()) // e.g. "V1StGXR8_Z5j"
```

`ActorID` is the correlation key surfaced in every `Observer` payload. It is **preserved across `Snapshot` / `Hydrate`** so the same logical actor keeps its identity across restarts.

### Sending Events

```go
actor.Send(EventIncrement)
actor.Send(EventStart)
```

Events are queued in a channel-based mailbox and processed sequentially, ensuring state transitions are never concurrent.

### Request-Scoped Context

To attach a `context.Context` to an event — for tracing IDs, request deadlines, or any value you want delivered to observer callbacks — use `SendCtx`:

```go
ctx := tracing.ContextWithSpan(req.Context(), span)
actor.SendCtx(ctx, EventDoTheThing)
```

The provided `ctx` is delivered as the first argument to every `Observer` callback fired in response to this event, including Always transitions chained after it. `Send(event)` is a thin wrapper around `SendCtx(context.Background(), event)`.

### Reading State

```go
// Get the deepest active leaf state
state := actor.State()

// Get ALL active states (useful for parallel states)
states := actor.States()

// Get a thread-safe copy of the context data
ctx := actor.Context()

// Get a full snapshot (active states, history, and context)
snap := actor.Snapshot()
```

All read methods are thread-safe (protected by `RWMutex`).

### Stopping an Actor

```go
actor.Stop()
```

`Stop()` cancels all running invocations, stops all timers, and closes the mailbox. It is safe to call multiple times.

---

## Persistence: Snapshot and Hydrate

Snapshots allow you to serialize the full state of an Actor and restore it later. This is critical for long-running workflows that must survive process restarts.

```go
// 1. Capture the current state
snapshot := actor.Snapshot()

// 2. Serialize to JSON (for storage in a database, file, etc.)
data, _ := json.MarshalIndent(snapshot, "", "  ")

// 3. Later, deserialize and restore
var loaded gstate.Snapshot[MyState, MyContext]
json.Unmarshal(data, &loaded)

actor2 := gstate.Hydrate(machine, loaded)
// actor2 is now in exactly the same state as the original
```

A `Snapshot` contains:
- **`Active []S`** — all currently active states
- **`History map[S]S`** — the history map (parent → remembered child)
- **`Context C`** — the context data
- **`ActorID ActorID`** — the producing actor's stable identifier

`Hydrate` restores the actor state and restarts any background services (invocations and timers) for active states, without re-executing entry actions. The hydrated actor keeps the original `ActorID`. For backwards compatibility, snapshots produced before `ActorID` existed (zero value) cause `Hydrate` to mint a fresh ID so the resulting actor always has a non-empty identifier.

`Hydrate` accepts the same functional options as `Start`, so you can attach an observer or tune the mailbox on a restored actor:

```go
rec := &gstate.RecordingObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext]{}
actor := gstate.Hydrate(machine, loaded,
    gstate.WithObserver[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext](rec),
    gstate.WithMailboxSize[MyState, MyEvent, MyContext](500),
)
```

`WithActorID` on `Hydrate` overrides the snapshot's `ActorID` (useful when forking or anonymizing); when omitted, the snapshot's ID wins.

> **Try it:** [persistence example](./examples/persistence) — snapshot to JSON and hydrate a new actor.

## Visualization & Export

`gstate` can export machine definitions to standard diagram formats for documentation, debugging, and visualization.

### Mermaid Diagrams

[`ToMermaid`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/floodfx/gstate#ToMermaid) converts a machine to a [Mermaid stateDiagram-v2](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/stateDiagram.html) string. The output renders natively on GitHub, GitLab, and any Mermaid-compatible viewer.

```go
fmt.Println(gstate.ToMermaid(machine))
```

Optional configuration via functional options:

```go
// Custom theme and title
gstate.ToMermaid(machine,
    gstate.MermaidTheme(gstate.MermaidThemeDark),
    gstate.MermaidTitle("My Workflow"),
    gstate.MermaidFontSize(20),
)
```

**Available themes:** `MermaidThemeDefault`, `MermaidThemeNeutral`, `MermaidThemeDark`, `MermaidThemeForest`, `MermaidThemeBase`

Embed directly in a README with a fenced code block:

````markdown
```mermaid
<output of ToMermaid(machine)>
```
````

### SCXML Export

[`ToSCXMLString`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/floodfx/gstate#ToSCXMLString) converts a machine to a [W3C SCXML](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) document. This enables interop with SCXML-compatible tools and runtimes.

```go
xml, err := gstate.ToSCXMLString(machine)
```

Also available:
- `ToSCXML(m)` — returns a structured `*SCXMLDocument`
- `ToSCXMLBytes(m)` — returns `[]byte` with XML header

#### What is exported

| Feature | Mermaid | SCXML |
|---------|---------|-------|
| States & transitions | ✓ | ✓ |
| Nested (compound) states | ✓ | ✓ |
| Parallel states | ✓ (fork/join) | ✓ (`<parallel>`) |
| Initial states | ✓ | ✓ |
| Final states | ✓ | ✓ |
| Guards (with labels) | ✓ | ✓ (`cond`) |
| Entry/exit actions | ✓ (notes) | ✓ |
| Delayed transitions | ✓ | ✓ (`<send>` + `after.*`) |
| History (shallow/deep) | ✓ (notes) | ✓ (`<history>`) |
| Invoke (onDone/onError) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Action labels | ✓ | ✓ (`<assign>`) |

> **Note:** Export captures the static structure of a machine definition. Runtime behavior (Go functions for guards, actions, invocations) cannot be serialized — labels are used as descriptive placeholders.

## System Architecture & Concurrency

`gstate` uses a hybrid concurrency model to ensure safety and performance:

- **Sequential Mailbox (Channels)**: All events sent via `actor.Send(event)` are queued. A background goroutine processes them one by one, ensuring that state transitions and context updates are **strictly sequential**.
- **Thread-Safe Access (RWMutex)**: Methods like `actor.State()`, `actor.States()`, `actor.Context()`, and `actor.Snapshot()` are safe to call concurrently. They use a read-lock to provide a consistent view of the actor.
- **Asynchronous Integrity**: `Invoke` and `After` run in separate goroutines but their results are funneled back through the sequential logic to prevent data races on your Context.

---

## Background & Resources

`gstate` is based on the formalisms of Statecharts, which provide a rigorous way to model complex, event-driven systems.

- **[Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/papers/Statecharts.pdf)**: The original 1987 paper by David Harel that introduced the concept.
- **[W3C SCXML Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/)**: The standard for State Chart XML, which defines many of the behaviors (like parallel states and history) implemented in this library.
- **[XState Documentation](https://xstate.js.org/docs/)**: An excellent resource for learning statechart patterns (the library that inspired `gstate`'s API).
